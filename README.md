# 🧠 Programming Fundamentals

Welcome to the **Programming Fundamentals** repository — a curated collection of theory, exercises, and mini-projects aimed at revisiting and strengthening the core programming concepts needed for advanced topics such as Cloud Computing, Distributed Systems, and Systems Design.

This repository is part of a broader recap and consolidation effort — it is not a beginner tutorial, but a professional knowledge base and practice archive built on prior academic study.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Consolidate knowledge in **imperative, object-oriented, and functional programming**
- Practice applying theoretical concepts via isolated examples
- Build a solid bridge from **programming paradigms** to **system-level thinking**
- Prepare foundational understanding to support topics like **algorithms**, **distributed systems**, and **web/backend architecture**

---

## 📚 Theory Coverage

Inside the `/theory` folder, you'll find concise, personal notes and summaries on:
- 🔹 OOP: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction
- 🔹 Functional Programming: higher-order functions, immutability, recursion
- 🔹 Imperative Paradigm: structured programming and flow control
- 🔹 Core CS Concepts: memory layout, file access, array structures, stack vs heap, pointers (with C examples)

These documents act as a quick refresher and are constantly updated as I integrate new insights.

---

## 💻 Practice Examples

The `/practice` section includes categorized code snippets:
- **Imperative**: control flow, file I/O, manual memory management (C/Python)
- **OOP**: class hierarchies, design patterns, method overriding (Java)
- **Functional**: pure functions, streams, filter/map/reduce patterns (Java/Python)

Each example is annotated and accompanied by short notes.

---

## 🚀 Projects

The `/projects` folder includes small but complete exercises such as:
- 📌 A command-line to-do list manager (imperative design)
- 📌 A mini library management system (OOP)
- 📌 A functional data transformation pipeline
- 📌 An event-driven observer simulator (functional + OOP)

Each project includes:
- `README.md` with context and goals
- Clear code structure
- Room for unit tests and future enhancements

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- `Java` (main OOP language)
- `Python` (light scripting and functional showcases)
- `C` (for pointers, memory, and imperative constructs)

---

## 📎 Notes

This repo will continue to grow as I revisit concepts while working on more advanced topics. It is meant to serve both as a **reference** and as a **launchpad** for deeper projects.

Feel free to explore, fork, or reach out with suggestions or contributions!
